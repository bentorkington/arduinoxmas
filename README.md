Arduino Christmas Lights

A program for making Christmas tree lights with your Arduino Uno, commented and easily adaptable, great way to get started with coding on Arduinos.

You need:

1 x Arduino microcontroller

1 x Breadboard for connecting the resistors

11 x LEDs. I use 6 red and 5 green, but you can use any colours you like.

11 x Resistors, 330-470 ohm.

Hookup wire for connecting everything. I use a mix of pin-to-pin cables for connecting from the Arduino to the breadboard, and pin-to-socket cables for the LEDs. You'll need long pin-to-socket cables if you have a big tree!
